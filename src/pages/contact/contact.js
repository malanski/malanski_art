            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I have advanced English and am passionate about the areas of technology and art,
                 my purpose is to unite them focusing on the Front-End Developer career. Area in 
                 which I study intensively, looking for challenges and projects to improve my 
                 technical knowledge and amplify my self-learning capacity.

                I worked for 7 years as an art teacher, a position in which I developed good 
                communication to exchange information and the ability to act under pressure. 
                At the same time, since 2011 I have been creating illustrations and drawings 
                in traditional and digital media as a freelance designer and illustrator.
